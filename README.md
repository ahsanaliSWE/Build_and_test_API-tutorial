## **Setup**

### Prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm**:
   - Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Firebase Project Setup**:
   - Sign up or log in to Firebase.
   - Create a new Firebase project through the Firebase Console.
   - Enable Firestore in the Cloud Firestore section.
   - Download the Firebase service account key (JSON file) from Project Settings > Service Accounts.
   
3. **Postman**:
   - Download and install Postman from [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/).

## **Building the RESTful API with Node.js and Firestore**

1. **Initialize Your Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-api-project
   cd my-api-project
   npm init -y
   
Install the required dependencies:
   'npm install express firebase-admin dotenv cors'
   
2. **Set Up Firebase Firestore**:
Log into Firebase using the CLI and initialize your project:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase init
   ```
Place the Firebase service account key in your project directory and add its path to your **.env** file:
 ```bash
FIREBASE_KEY_PATH=./serviceAccountKey.json
```
Create a new file named **server.js** and initialize Firebase in it:
```javascript
const express = require('express'); 
const cors = require('cors'); 
require('dotenv').config(); 
const admin = require('firebase-admin'); 
const serviceAccount = require(process.env.FIREBASE_KEY_PATH);
  
admin.initializeApp({ 
     credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount), 
}); 

const db = admin.firestore();  

const app = express(); 
app.use(cors()); 
app.use(express.json());
  
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; 
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

## Testing with Postman:
You can test the API using either Postman or directly in your browser for basic operations like GET.
* Start the server
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
 * **Open Postman** and create requests for each endpoint:
    
    *   **POST** to add data: http://localhost:3000/add - Add a new document. Provide data in the request body.
        
    *   **GET** to retrieve data: http://localhost:3000/get - Retrieve all documents.
        
    *   **PUT** to update data: http://localhost:3000/update/:id - Update a document using its ID. Provide new data in the body.
        
    *   **DELETE** to remove data: http://localhost:3000/delete/:id - Delete a document by its ID.
        

Test each route to ensure the API works correctly.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Congratulations! You've built and tested your very own RESTful API using Node.js, Firebase Firestore, and Postman. Keep exploring and tweaking things as you goâ€Šâ€”â€Šthere's always more to learn in this digital world. Happy coding! ðŸš€

**Note**
Add the **serviceAccountKey.json** with your actual Firebase service account key file in the project directory.
